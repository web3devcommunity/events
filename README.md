## Events

- This is to collaborate on editing & recording events metadata organized by web3dev.community
- In future we might generalize and curate related events together

## Motivations
1. self-sovereignty on data and be platform-agnoistic, transparent, easy to crowdsource
2. sync as iCalendar RFC 2445 ICS & publish as CalDAV, be consumable on website

## Notes
- TODO: no-code to generate the feed
- Organizer Playbooks will be documented separately
